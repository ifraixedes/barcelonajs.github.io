		"description": "AngularJS uses its HTML directives at the core of its UI generation. That means that you specify how to generate the HTML using HTML. Part of that logic has been moved to the controller functions, but part of it cannot be moved. The result is imperative constructs like ng-if and ng-repeat inside the declarative HTML template. The mismatch between an imperative problem and a declarative tool ends up in a messy solution in the long run. JSP tried the same thing with custom tag libraries, and failed. XSL tried the same thing, and failed too. This talk will get into deeper detail about why I believe that the HTML directives - one of the core elements that AngularJS is praised for - is not such a great solution for UI generation."

		"description": "You've heard of TypeScript, but you're not sure if it's a good idea, and you've never really seen it in action. TypeScript is powerful though, rapidly gaining momentum, and has a lot more to offer than just JS + classes. Let's take a proper look. In this talk we'll dig a bit deeper and play around with some of the more interesting features TypeScript gives you. We'll walk through the extras that TypeScript provides and how they'll solve your every woe, learn a bit about where the types come in and why'd you care, and see how exactly you might put it into action on your next Node project."
